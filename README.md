# Elections

This is a project for the Carleton Computer Science Society.

The MVP for this will include the following:

* An administration panel where you can view and export statistics regarding the election
* A simple HTML form with input validation protected
* Allow configuration through as of yet undetermined method (probably a JSON file)
* HTTPS support in some way shape or form.
